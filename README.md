# Mindo
### Overview
Mindo started out as a class project that I have continued to work on after submission. The goal of the project was creating a very simple and incredibly minimal todo list web page. I wanted a very quick way to get a little list of tasks going.

### Tech Stack
Because it was a learning project, Mindo has a vanilla stack of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
