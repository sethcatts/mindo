# Mindo
The goal of Mindo was creating a very simple and incredibly minimal todo list web page. As a learning project, Mindo has many flaws from the HTML to the way that tasks are kept in local browser storage.

These problems may be fixed on a later refactor but for now Mindo stands as one of my first webdev projects
### A demo of Mindo can be found at devcatts.me
