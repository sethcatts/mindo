# Mindo
### Overview
Mindo started out as a class project that I continued to work on after submission. The goal of the project was creating a very simple and incredibly minimal todo list web page. I wanted a very quick way to get a little list of tasks going that includeds some organization using only the keyboard.

A live instance of Mindo can be found here: https://sethcatts.github.io/mindo/main.html

### Tech Stack
Due to its very minimal codebase and functionality Mindo has a tech stack of HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
