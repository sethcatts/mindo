            <h4>Creating Tasks</h4>
        	<p>You can start creating tasks in Mindo by clicking on the
        	   text area at the top of the page</p>
        	<p>Tasks can be added by clicking on the "+" button to the right
        	   of the text area or by hitting enter on your keyboard</p>
            <p>By default your tasks will be added to list 1 which will always
                be the list closest to the top of the page followed by list 2
            and list 3</p>

        <div style="display: table-cell;" class="section">
            <h4>Selecting a List</h4>
        	<p>Mindo can have up to 3 different lists at any time</p>
            <p>Adding a task to one of the lists is as easy as selecting the
                list you want your task added to and creating the task as
                normal</p>
            <p>While typing a task you can quickly switch between which list
                you will be adding to by using the up and down arrow keys on
                your keyboard</p>

            <h4>Closing and Marking Tasks</h4>
        	<p>Tasks can be marked and unmarked by clicking anywhere on the
                 task itself</p>
            <p>Marking a task is a way to indicate that the task is complete
                but still be able to read it or unmark it should it need to
                be revisited.<p>
            <p>To close a task click the close button on the right side of the
                task</p>

                that even if you restart your browser or computer your task
